  important.

* **Establishing the premise:** There is a premise on what the idea is established for the current round of inferences. Remember, in astronomy establishing the exact cause is impractical. We are only observationalist of the universe and can only speculate about observations given to us. Only, any further observation will refute or support the claim. Therefore given certain observations and intuition, one must go forward to accept the premise and start setting up speculation (ideas) on what seems physically and mathematically right.
* **Having a speculation is better than not having one:** You have speculated something about the object or mechanism by mixing what observations are telling you and what your intuitions are saying. Within the realms of physics, you can make as many bold claims as possible as long as the observations are or will support such a claim. In cases like these, where any guess is a good guess about the actual physics involved in the mechanism, some speculation is always better than no speculation as it brings you intuitively closer to the true model. This is how many great scientists have operated in their life.
